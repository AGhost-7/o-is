# Express Example
This is a full fledged example REST API.

The example requires docker and docker-compose. Make sure to have it installed
on your machine first. You will need to bring up the services with
`docker-compose up` after that.

To initialize the database, run `npm run init` from the command line.

To run the application, run `node index.js` from the command line
